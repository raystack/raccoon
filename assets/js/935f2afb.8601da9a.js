With wesockets it provides long persistent connections, with no overhead of additional headers sizes as in http protocol. Racoon supports protocol buffers and JSON as serialization formats. Websockets and REST API support both whereas with gRPC only protocol buffers are supported. It provides an event type agnostic API that accepts a batch \\\\(array\\\\) of events in protobuf format.
