Raccoon is high throughput, low-latency service that provides an API to ingest clickstream data from mobile apps, sites and publish it to Kafka. Raccoon uses the Websocket protocol for peer-to-peer communication and protobuf as the serialization format. It provides an event type agnostic API that accepts a batch (array) of events in protobuf format. Refer [here](https://github.com/raystack/proton/tree/main/raystack/raccoon) for proto definition format that Raccoon accepts.

## Key Features

- **Event Agnostic** - Raccoon API is event agnostic. This allows you to push any event with any schema.
- **Event Distribution** - Events are distributed to kafka topics based on the event meta-data
- **High performance** - Long running persistent, peer-to-peer connection reduce connection set up overheads. Websocket provides reduced battery consumption for mobile apps (based on usage statistics)
- **Guaranteed Event Delivery** - Server acknowledgements based on delivery. Currently it acknowledges failures/successes. Server can be augmented for zero-data loss or at-least-once guarantees.
- **Reduced payload sizes** - Protobuf based
- **Metrics:** - Built-in monitoring includes latency and active connections.

## Use cases

Raccoon can be used as an event collector, event distributor and as a forwarder of events generated from mobile/web/IoT front ends as it provides an high volume, high throughput, low latency event-agnostic APIs. Raccoon can serve the needs of data ingestion in near-real-time. Some domains where Raccoon could be used is listed below

- Adtech streams: Where digital marketing data from external sources can be ingested into the organization backends
- Clickstream: Where user behavior data can be streamed in real-time
- Edge systems: Where devices (say in the IoT world) need to send data to the cloud.
- Event Sourcing: Such as Stock updates dashboards, autonomous/self-drive use cases

## Run with Docker

**Prerequisite**

- Docker installed

**Run Docker Image**

Raccoon provides Docker [image](https://hub.docker.com/r/raystack/raccoon) as part of the release. Make sure you have Kafka running on your local and run the following.

```sh
# Download docker image from docker hub
$ docker pull raystack/raccoon

# Run the following docker command with minimal config.
$ docker run -p 8080:8080 \
  -e SERVER_WEBSOCKET_PORT=8080 \
  -e SERVER_WEBSOCKET_CONN_ID_HEADER=X-User-ID \
  -e PUBLISHER_KAFKA_CLIENT_BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS=host.docker.internal:9093 \
  -e EVENT_DISTRIBUTION_PUBLISHER_PATTERN=clickstream-%s-log \
  raystack/raccoon
```

**Run Docker Compose**
You can also use `docker-compose` on this repo. The `docker-compose` provides raccoon along with Kafka setup. Then, run the following command.

```sh
# Run raccoon along with kafka setup
$ make docker-run
# Stop the docker compose
$ make docker-stop
```

You can consume the published events from the host machine by using `localhost:9094` as kafka broker server. Mind the [topic routing](https://raystack.github.io/raccoon/concepts/architecture#event-distribution) when you consume the events.

## Running locally

Prerequisite:

- You need to have [GO](https://golang.org/) 1.14 or above installed
- You need `protoc` [installed](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf#protocol-compiler-installation)

```sh
# Clone the repo
$ git clone https://github.com/raystack/raccoon.git

# Build the executable
$ make

# Configure env variables
$ vim .env

# Run Raccoon
$ ./out/raccoon
```

**Note:** Read the detail of each configurations [here](https://raystack.github.io/raccoon/reference/configuration).

## Running tests

```sh
# Running unit tests
$ make test

# Running integration tests
$ cp .env.test .env
$ make docker-run
$ INTEGTEST_BOOTSTRAP_SERVER=localhost:9094 INTEGTEST_HOST=localhost:8080 INTEGTEST_TOPIC_FORMAT="clickstream-%s-log" GRPC_SERVER_ADDR="localhost:8081" go test ./integration -v
```
