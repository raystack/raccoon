# Metrics

Raccoon uses Statsd protocol as way to report metrics. You can capture the metrics using any supported statsd collector like [Telegraf](https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf). This page contains reference for all the metrics for Raccoon.

## Server Connection

### `server_ping_failure_total`

Total ping that server fails to send

- Type: `Counting`
- Tags: `conn_group=*`

### `server_pong_failure_total`

Total pong that server fails to send

- Type: `Counting`
- Tags: `conn_group=*`

### `connections_count_current`

Number of alive connections

- Type: `Gauge`
- Tags: `conn_group=*`

### `user_connection_success_total`

Number of successful connections established to the server

- Type: `Count`

- Type: `Count`
- Tags: `reason=ugfailure` `reason=exists` `reason=serverlimit` `conn_group=*`

### `user_session_duration_milliseconds`

Duration of alive connection per session per connection

- Type: `Timing`

## Kafka Publisher

### `kafka_messages_delivered_total`

Number of delivered events to Kafka. The metric also contains false increments. To find the true value, one should use the difference between this and `kafka_messages_undelivered_total` metric for the same tag/labels.

- Type: `Count`
- Tags: `success=false` `success=true` `conn_group=*` `event_type=*`

### `kafka_messages_undelivered_total`

The count of false increments done by `kafka_messages_delivered_total`. To be used in conjunction with the former for accurate metrics.

- Type: `Count`
- Tags: `success=false` `success=true` `conn_group=*` `event_type=*`


### `kafka_unknown_topic_failure_total`

Number of delivery failure caused by topic does not exist in kafka.

- Type: `Count`
- Tags: `topic=topicname` `event_type=*`

### `kafka_tx_messages_total`

Total number of messages transmitted \(produced\) to Kafka brokers.

- Type: `Gauge`

### `kafka_tx_messages_bytes_total`

Total number of message bytes \(including framing, such as per-Message framing and MessageSet/batch framing\) transmitted to Kafka brokers

- Type: `Gauge`

### `kafka_brokers_tx_total`

Total number of requests sent to Kafka brokers

- Type: `Gauge`
- Tags: `broker=broker_nodes`

### `kafka_brokers_tx_bytes_total`

Total number of bytes transmitted to Kafka brokers

- Type: `Gauge`
- Tags: `broker=broker_nodes`

### `kafka_brokers_rtt_average_milliseconds`

Broker latency / round-trip time in microseconds

- Type: `Gauge`
- Tags: `broker=broker_nodes`

### `ack_event_rtt_ms`

Time taken from ack function called by kafka producer to processed by the ack handler.

- Type: `Timing`
- Tags: NA

### `event_rtt_ms`

Time taken from event is consumed from the queue to be acked by the ack handler.

- Type: `Timing`
- Tags: NA

### `kafka_producebulk_tt_ms`

Response time of produce batch method of the kafka producer

- Type `Timing`
- Tags: NA

### `server_mem_gc_count_current`

The number of completed GC cycle

- Type: `Gauge`

### `server_mem_gc_pauseTotalNs_current`

The cumulative nanoseconds in GC stop-the-world pauses since the program started

- Type: `Gauge`

### `server_mem_heap_alloc_bytes_current`

Bytes of allocated heap objects

- Type: `Gauge`

### `server_mem_heap_inuse_bytes_current`

HeapInuse is bytes in in-use spans

- Type: `Gauge`

### `server_mem_heap_objects_total_current`

Number of allocated heap objects

- Type: `Gauge`

### `server_go_routines_count_current`

Number of goroutine spawn in a single flush

- Type: `Gauge`

### `server_mem_stack_inuse_bytes_current`

Bytes in stack spans

- Type: `Gauge`

## Event Delivery

Following metrics are event delivery reports. Each metrics reported at a different point in time. See the diagram below for to understand when each metrics are reported.

### `events_rx_bytes_total`

Total byte receieved in requests

- Type: `Count`
- Tags: `conn_group=*` `event_type=*`

### `events_rx_total`

Number of events received in requests

- Type: `Count`
- Tags: `conn_group=*` `event_type=*`

### `events_duplicate_total`

Number of duplicate events

- Type: `Count`
