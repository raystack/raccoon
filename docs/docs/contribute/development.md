# Development Guide

This guide is targeted at developers looking to contribute to Raccoon.

## Making a Pull Request

### Incorporating upstream changes from main

Our preference is the use of `git rebase` instead of `git merge` : `git pull -r`

### Signing commits

Commits have to be signed before they are allowed to be merged into the codebase:

```bash
# Include -s flag to sign off
git commit -s -m "My first commit"
```

### Good practices to keep in mind

* Follow [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#summary) while composing our commit messages.
* Add `WIP:` to PR name if more work needs to be done prior to review
* Avoid `force-pushing` as it makes reviewing difficult

**Managing CI-test failures**

* GitHub runner tests
  * Click `checks` tab to analyse failed tests
